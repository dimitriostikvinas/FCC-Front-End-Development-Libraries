# FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Projects

This repository contains the mini projects I completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Front End Development curriculum alongside with programming notes. These projects demonstrate my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, including front end libraries and frameworks, such as React, Redux, Bootstrap, jQuery and SASS.
